# Deliverable2_DanceFloorProject
 Second release of the DanceFloorProject, made by Gerard Cabot, Henrique Coimbra and MartÃ­ Vera.

 Things added:
 
 -Game funcionality --> arrows appears in certain coordinates for the 2 players.
 
 -Diferent arrows for every player --> each player has his own arrows.
 
 -Music added --> first test of music (it not will be the final music).

 Basically this is a first demo of how the game will be, first when the game is open the two arrows are spawned, one for each player. When a player touches that arrow it will generate another one
 this will create a logic circuit that for instance is very basic, the idea is to develop this and add more arrows and create a logic and fun circuit. So by now it's just a simple demo of how the game
 will work.
